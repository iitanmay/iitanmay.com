During the summer of 2025, we hosted Animesh Yadav (B. Tech. student at Thapar University, Patiala) for two months in the Fluid Mechanics laboratory at IIT Delhi.

In this internship, he conducted simulations of viscosity-stratified jets using RANS closure models. We wanted to see how the injection of a low-viscosity fluid into a high-viscosity ambient, without any density anomaly, affects the flow statistics.

He used a viscosity ratio ($m = \frac{\nu_{host}}{\nu_{jet}}$) to quantify their dynamics. Figure 1 shows the qualitative distribution of axial velocity which clearly demonstrates how a more viscous ambient results in a larger radial spread of the jet.

He validated these numerical results against an experimental work with similar setup and parameter space. This validation is shown in figure 2 where he favorably compares the decay rate of centerline velocity ($1/B_u$), and the spread rate of the jet ($c$).

He will be presenting this work during the Fluid Mechanics and Fluid Power (FMFP) Conference in December 2025.
