I recently completed my PhD in Applied Mechanics from IIT Delhi, specializing in experimental and computational fluid dynamics. My research focuses on fluid transport, air curtains, and gravity currents.

This website serves as my professional portfolio, detailing my research interests, publications, and past projects.
