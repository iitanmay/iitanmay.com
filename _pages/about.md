I completed my PhD in Applied Mechanics from IIT Delhi under the supervision of [Prof. Narsing K. Jha](https://narsingjha.github.io/) and [Prof. Vamsi K. Chalamalla](https://sites.google.com/site/vkchalama/). I worked in the broad area of environmental fluid dynamics which encompasses understanding the nature of environmental and geophysical flows through experimental and computational measures. My PhD thesis aimed to provide a better understanding of the transport dynamics of buoyant jets with application in air curtains which are generally installed in shopping complexes, restaurants, food cabinets etc.

Prior to the PhD, I pursued an MPhil at the University of Melbourne (Supervisors: [Prof. Joe Klewicki](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/370500-joseph-klewicki) and [Prof. Jimmy Philip](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/382360-jimmy-philip)) and an MS at National Tsing Hua University (Advisor: [Prof. Chao-An Lin](https://pme.site.nthu.edu.tw/p/406-1308-73995,r4027.php?Lang=en)) in Taiwan. Earlier, I had completed an undergraduate degree from National Institute of Technology (NIT) Hamirpur India.

This website serves as my professional portfolio, detailing my research interests, publications, and past projects.
